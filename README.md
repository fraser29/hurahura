Organisation and automation tools for medical imaging research data

## About

This is a collection of classes for following OOP principals for organisation of research data for medical imaging research studies. 

It takes advantage of the dicom standard and the package [spydcmtk](https://github.com/fraser29/spydcmtk) for automating and generalising many typical steps with the intention of making the researcher's life easier. 

This package may be easily adapted and expanded upon for a high level control over your research data. Or, it may be used as is for basic structure and organisation of data and automation of common tasks.
