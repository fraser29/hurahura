# miresearchui


Currently setup to permit load a subjlist from select a directory. Or have some preloaded projs with buttons to switch to

Shows: 
ID, Name, DOS, Age, Open (open allows to view subj specific data)

TODO : run action 

- need to have subj class passed with preloads (not sure how could manage from select)
- down track could load a config file. 


## RUN

```bash

source DEV/envs/niceui/bin/activate
# Need this as watches directory
cd /home/fraser/DEV/niceui_work/
python miresearchui/main.py
```
